Mini Shell – C Project
📖 Overview

This project implements a simplified command-line shell in C.
The goal is to understand the inner workings of shells, including process creation, input/output handling, and basic command execution.

This project demonstrates system programming concepts such as forking, executing commands, pipes, and redirection in a Unix-like environment.

✨ Features

Execute simple commands with arguments (e.g., ls -l, echo hello)

Support for built-in commands like cd and exit

Handle input/output redirection (>, <)

Support command chaining with pipes (|)

Interactive shell prompt

Graceful handling of invalid commands
